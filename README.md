## Description

_This website allows the user to make a pizza from the given options, and have various add ons. Upon submission, the form will calculate the total cost, and display an itemized list of what they ordered, with costs for each. At the bottom of the reciept, it shows the subtotal, tax, and final total. Due to using required in the HTML for the pizza options (but only the pizza options), the user is forced to make a pizza.
